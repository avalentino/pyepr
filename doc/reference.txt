API Reference
=============

.. module:: epr
   :synopsis: Python bindings for ENVISAT Product Reader C API

PyEPR_ provides Python_ bindings for the ENVISAT Product Reader C API
(`EPR API`_) for reading satellite data from ENVISAT_ ESA_ (European
Space Agency) mission.

PyEPR_ is fully object oriented and, as well as the `EPR API`_ for C,
supports ENVISAT_ MERIS, AATSR Level 1B and Level 2 and also ASAR data
products. It provides access to the data either on a geophysical
(decoded, ready-to-use pixel samples) or on a raw data layer.
The raw data access makes it possible to read any data field contained
in a product file.

      Creates a raster which is compatible with the data type of the band

      The created raster is used to read the data in it (see
      :meth:`Band.read_raster`).

      The raster is defined on the grid of the product, from which the
      data are read. Spatial subsets and under-sampling are possible)
      through the parameter of the method.

      A raster is an object that allows direct access to data of a
      certain portion of the ENVISAT product that are read into the it.
      Such a portion is called the source. The complete ENVISAT product
      can be much greater than the source. One can move the raster over
      the complete ENVISAT product and read in turn different parts
      (always of the size of the source) of it into the raster.
      The source is specified by the parameters *height* and *width*.

      A typical example is a processing in blocks. Lets say, a block
      has 64x32 pixel. Then, my source has a width of 64 pixel and a
      height of 32 pixel.

      Another example is a processing of complete image lines. Then,
      my source has a widths of the complete product (for example 1121
      for a MERIS RR product), and a height of 1). One can loop over
      all blocks read into the raster and process it.

      In addition, it is possible to defined a sub-sampling step for
      a raster. This means, that the source is not read 1:1 into the
      raster, but that only every 2nd or 3rd pixel is read. This step
      can be set differently for the across track (source_step_x) and
      along track (source_step_y) directions.

      :param src_width:
            the width (across track dimension) of the source to be read
            into the raster
      :param src_height:
            the height (along track dimension) of the source to be read
            into the raster
      :param xstep:
            the sub-sampling step across track of the source when reading
            into the raster. Default: 1.
      :param ystep:
            the sub-sampling step along track of the source when reading
            into the raster. Default: 1.
      :returns:
            the new raster instance or raises an exception
            (:exc:`EPRValueError`) if an error occurred

      The height of the source

      The width of the source


   .. attribute:: source_step_x

      The sub-sampling for the across-track direction in pixel


   .. attribute:: source_step_y

      The sub-sampling for the along-track direction in pixel


   .. attribute:: data

      Raster data exposed as :class:`numpy.ndarray` object

      .. note:: this property shares the data buffer with the :class:`Raster`
                object so any change in its contents is also reflected to
                the :class:`Raster` object

      .. note:: this property has no correspondent in the C API


   .. method:: get_pixel(x, y)

      Single pixel access

      This function is for getting the values of the elements of a
      raster (i.e. pixel)

      :param x:
            the (zero-based) X coordinate of the pixel
      :param y:
            the (zero-based) Y coordinate of the pixel
      :returns:
            the typed value at the given co-ordinate


   .. method:: get_elem_size

      The size in byte of a single element (sample) of this raster's
      buffer


   .. method:: get_height

      Gets the raster's height in pixels


   .. method:: get_width

      Gets the raster's width in pixels

EPRTime
~~~~~~~

.. class:: EPRTime

   Convenience class for time data exchange.

   EPRTime is a :class:`collections.namedtuple` with the following fields:

   .. attribute:: days
   .. attribute:: seconds
   .. attribute:: microseconds


Functions
---------

.. function:: open(filename)

   Opens the ENVISAT product

   Opens the ENVISAT product file with the given file path, reads MPH,
   SPH and all DSDs, organized the table with parameter of line length
   and tie points number.

   :param product_file_path:
        the path to the ENVISAT product file
   :returns:
        the :class:`Product` instance representing the specified
        product. An exception (:exc:`exceptions.ValueError`) is raised
        if the file could not be opened.

   .. seealso :class:`Product`


.. function:: data_type_id_to_str

   Gets the 'C' data type string for the given data type


.. function:: get_data_type_size

   Gets the size in bytes for an element of the given data type


.. function:: get_sample_model_name

   Return the name of the specified sample model


.. function:: get_scaling_method_name

   Return the name of the specified scaling method


.. function:: create_raster(data_type, src_width, src_height[, xstep, ystep])

   Creates a raster of the specified data type

   This function can be used to create any type of raster, e.g. for
   later use as a bit-mask.

   :param data_type:
        the type of the data to stored in the raster, must be one of
        E_TID_*.

        .. seealso:: `Data type Identifiers`_

   :param src_width:
        the width (across track dimension) of the source to be read
        into the raster.
        See description of :meth:`Band.create_compatible_raster`
   :param src_height:
        the height (along track dimension) of the source to be read
        into the raster.
        See description of :meth:`Band.create_compatible_raster`
   :param xstep:
        the sub-sampling step across track of the source when reading
        into the raster. Default: 1.
   :param ystep:
        the sub-sampling step along track of the source when reading
        into the raster. Default: 1.
   :returns:
        the new :class:`Raster` instance

   .. seealso:: description of :meth:`Band.create_compatible_raster`


.. function:: create_bitmask_raster(src_width, src_height[, xstep, ystep])

   Creates a raster to be used for reading bitmasks

   The raster returned always is of type ``byte``.

   :param src_width:
        the width (across track dimension) of the source to be read
        into the raster
   :param src_height:
        the height (along track dimension) of the source to be read
        into the raster
   :param xstep:
        the sub-sampling step across track of the source when reading
        into the raster. Default: 1.
   :param ystep:
        the sub-sampling step along track of the source when reading
        into the raster. Default: 1.
   :returns:
        the new raster instance or raises an exception
        (:exc:`EPRValueError`) if an error occurred

   .. seealso:: the description of :meth:`Band.create_compatible_raster`
