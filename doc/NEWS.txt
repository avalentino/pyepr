Change history
==============


PyEPR 0.8 (07/09/2013)
----------------------

* now the :class:`epr.Product` objects have a :meth:`epr.Product.close`
  method that can be used to explicitly close products without relying
  on the garbage collector behaviour (closes :issue:`7`)
* new :attr:`epr.Product.closed` (read-only) attribute that can be used to
  check if a :class:`epr.Product` has been closed
* the :class:`Product` class now supports context management so they can be
  used in ``with`` statements
* added entries for :data:`epr.__version__` and :data:`epr.__revision__` in
  the reference manual
* the :data:`epr.__revision__` module attribute is now deprecated
* some *cythonization* warnings have been fixed
* several small improvements to the documentation


PyEPR 0.7.1 (19/08/2013)
------------------------

* fixed potential issues with conversion from python strings to ``char*``
* new snapshot of the EPR C API sources (2.3dev):

  - the size of the record tables has been fixed
  - the EPR_NUM_PRODUCT_TABLES has been fixed
  - fixed a missing prototype
  - several GCC warnings has been silenced
  - additional checks on return codes
  - now and error is raised when an invalid flag name is used

* better factorization of Python 3 specific code
* use the *CLOUD* flag instead of *BRIGHT* in unit tests
* added function/method signature to all doc-strings for better interactive
  help
* several improvements to the documentation:

  - updated the :file:`README.txt` file to mention EPR C API sourced inclusion
    in the PyEPR 0.7 (and lates) source tar-ball
  - small fix in the installation instructions: the pip tool does not have  a
    "--prefix" parameter
  - always use the python3 syntax for the *print* function in all examples in
    the documentation
  - links to older (and dev) versions of the documentation have been added in
    the man page of the HTML doc
  - removed *date* form the doc meta-data.  The documentation build date is
    reported in the front page of the LaTeX (PDF) doc and, starting from this
    release, in the footer of the HTML doc.
  - the Ohloh_ widget has been added in the sidebar of the HTML doc
  - improved the regexp for detecting the SW version in the :file`setup.py`
    script
  - formatting

PyEPR 0.7 (04/08/2013)
----------------------

* more detailed error messages in case of open failures
* new sphinx theme for the HTML documentation
* `Travis-CI`_ has been set-up for the project
* now the source tar-ball also includes a copy of the EPR C API sources
  so that no external C library is required to build PyEPR.

  This features also makes it easier to install PyEPR using pip.

  The user can still guild PyEPR against a system version of the ERP-API
  library simply using the :option:`--epr-api-src` option of the
  :file:`setup.py` script with "None"" as value.

  The ERP C API included in the source tar-ball is version *2.3dev-pyepr062*,
  a development and patched version that allows the following enhancements.

  - support for ERS products in ENVISAT format
  - support for ASAR products generated with the new ASAR SW version 6.02
    (ref. doc. PO-RS-MDA-GS-2009_4/C
  - fix incorrect reading of "incident_angle" bands (closes :issue:`6`).
    The issue is in the EPR C API.

PyEPR 0.6.1 (26/04/2012)
------------------------

* fix compatibility with cython_ 0.16
* added a new option to the setup script (:option:`--epr-api-src`) to build
  PyEPR using the EPR-API C sources


PyEPR 0.6 (12/08/2011)
----------------------

* full support for `Python 3`_
* improved code highligh in the documentation
* depend from cython >= 0.13 instead of cython >= 0.14.1.
  Cythonizing :file:`epr.pyx` with `Python 3`_ requires cython >= 0.15


PyEPR 0.5 (25/04/2011)
----------------------

* stop using :c:func:`PyFile_AsFile` that is no more available in
  `Python 3`_
* now documentation uses intersphinx_ capabilities
* code examples added to documentation
* tutorials added to documentation
* the LICENSE.txt file is now included in the source distribution
* the cython_ construct ``with nogil`` is now used instead of calling
  :c:func:`Py_BEGIN_ALLOW_THREADS` and :c:func:`Py_END_ALLOW_THREADS`
  directly
* dropped old versions of cython_; now cython_ 0.14.1 or newer is required
* suppressed several constness related warnings

PyEPR 0.4 (10/04/2011)
----------------------

* fixed a bug in the :meth:`epr.Product.__str__`, :meth:`Dataset.__str__`
  and :meth:`erp.Band.__repr__` methods (bad formatting)
* fixed :meth:`epr.Field.get_elems` method for char and uchar data types
* implemented :meth:`epr.Product.read_bitmask_raster`, now the
  :class:`epr.Product` API is complete
* fixed segfault in :meth:`epr.Field.get_unit` method when the field
  has no unit
* a smaller dataset is now used for unit tests
* a new tutorial section has been added to the user documentation


PyEPR 0.3 (01/04/2011)
----------------------

* version string of the EPR C API is now exposed as module attribute
  :data:`epr.EPR_C_API_VERSION`
* implemented ``__repr__``, ``__str__``, ``__eq__``, ``__ne__`` and
  ``__iter__`` special methods
* added utility methods (not included in the C API) like:

  - :meth:`epr.Record.get_field_names`
  - :meth:`epr.Record.fields`
  - :meth:`epr.Dataset.records`
  - :meth:`epr.Product.get_dataset_names`
  - :meth:`epr.Product.get_band_names`
  - :meth:`epr.Product.datasets`
  - :meth:`epr.Product.bands`

* fixed a logic error that caused empty messages in custom EPR
  exceptions


PyEPR 0.2 (20/03/2011)
----------------------

* sphinx_ documentation added
* added docstrings to all method and classes
* renamed some method and parameter in order to avoid redundancies and
  have a more *pythonic*  API
* in case of null pointers a :exc:`epr.EPRValueError` is raised
* improved C library shutdown management
* introduced some utility methods to :class:`epr.Product` and
  :class:`epr.Record` classes
