"""Example for using the epr-api

Demonstrates how to open a MERIS L1b product and calculate the NDVI.

This example does not demonstrate how to write good and safe code.
It is reduced to the essentials for working with the epr-api.

Calling sequence::

    $ python3 write_ndvi.py <envisat-product> <output-file>

for example::

    $ python3 write_ndvi.py MER_RR__1P_test.N1 my_ndvi.raw
