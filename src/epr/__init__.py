"""Python bindings for ENVISAT Product Reader C API.

PyEPR_ provides Python_ bindings for the ENVISAT Product Reader C API
(`EPR API`_) for reading satellite data from ENVISAT_ ESA_ (European
Space Agency) mission.

PyEPR_ is fully object oriented and, as well as the `EPR API`_ for C,
supports ENVISAT_ MERIS, AATSR Level 1B and Level 2 and also ASAR data
products. It provides access to the data either on a geophysical
(decoded, ready-to-use pixel samples) or on a raw data layer.
The raw data access makes it possible to read any data field contained
in a product file.
